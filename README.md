Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?


Throughout Project Three, I learned that building a mobile app is about much more than just creating a clean UI; it’s about designing a system that anticipates user needs, handles edge cases, and delivers a reliable experience under real-world conditions. My app was designed to help frontline workers manage inventory quickly and accurately, with features like editable item fields, quantity controls, and low-stock alerts. I kept users in mind by designing large, accessible touch targets and fallback logic for denied permissions, ensuring the app remained functional even without SMS access. The Edit Item screen became the heart of the app, where I combined UI design, permission handling, and dynamic messaging to create a user-centered experience.
I approached development with a modular mindset, breaking logic into reusable methods and testing each component thoroughly in the emulator. I used runtime permission checks, safe parsing, and clear UI feedback to make the app resilient and intuitive. Testing revealed subtle bugs—like null pointer risks and layout mismatches that I was able to fix before they became user-facing issues. One of the biggest lessons I learned was to always budget more time for debugging and to look for ways to reduce repetitive code through utility methods and shared layouts. Moving forward, I’ll apply these strategies to future projects and plan to refine and launch this app on the Google Play Store as a portfolio piece. This project helped me grow from a backend-focused coder into a full-stack mobile developer who builds with empathy, clarity, and production-readiness in mind.
